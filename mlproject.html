    <h2>Machine Learning Projects.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am passionate about machine learning and have worked 
        on several exciting projects in this field. My machine learning projects encompass a wide
         range of applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to 
         predictive analytics and anomaly detection. Using state-of-the-art algorithms and 
         techniques, I have developed models that can accurately classify and predict
          outcomes based on complex datasets. Each project showcases my ability to
           leverage data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. I am constantly expanding my
            knowledge and exploring innovative approaches to stay at the forefront of this
             rapidly evolving field. Feel free to explore my projects and see how I harness
              the power of machine learning to drive meaningful results</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Skin Cancer Detiction</h5>
           <b> Objective:</b> Every year there are more new cases of skin cancer than the combined incidence of cancers of the breast, prostate, lung and colon.
                 An estimated 87,110 new cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2017.
                 The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients whose melanoma is detected early is about 98 percent in the U.S. The survival rate falls to 62 percent when the disease reaches the lymph nodes, and 18 percent when the disease metastasizes to distant organs.
                 Early detection is critical!</p>

            <p class="card-text">i developed a book store website integrated with a machine learning
                recommendation system. The system suggests similar books to

            <p class="card-text"><b>Upward trend:</b> Tata stock is expected to continue its upward trajectory based on positive market sentiment, strong financial performance, and strategic investments in key sectors. Factors such as increased demand for Tata's products and services, successful acquisitions, and effective cost management contribute to the optimistic outlook.<br>
                 <b>Diversification benefits:</b> Tata's diverse business portfolio across industries such as automotive, steel, IT services, and consumer goods provides a cushion against sector-specific risks. This diversification strategy allows the company to navigate market fluctuations and capitalize on emerging opportunities, enhancing its long-term growth prospects.<br>
                 <b>External factors:</b> While Tata's strong fundamentals and strategic positioning contribute to its positive outlook, it is important to consider external factors such as global economic conditions, geopolitical developments, and regulatory changes that can influence the stock price. Monitoring these factors is crucial for assessing the overall market sentiment and potential impact on Tata's stock performance.<br>

            <h5 class="card-title">SpaceX</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> To optimize the recovery process, SpaceX has tasked us with training a machine learning model to predict the success of the first stage recovery process. By analyzing historical data on past launches, we will train the model to identify patterns and correlations between various factors and the success or failure of the recovery process. The model will then be used to make real-time predictions during future launches, allowing SpaceX to optimize its recovery process and improve the efficiency of its rocket technology.
                  This project requires a strong understanding of data science and machine learning techniques, as well as knowledge of the space industry and the Falcon 9 rocket technology. By successfully completing this project, we will contribute to the advancement of reusable rocket technology and make space launches more cost-effective and sustainable.
