<!-- PHP code for processing form submission -->
<?php
  // check if form is submitted
  if(isset($_POST['submit'])) {
    // retrieve form data
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $message = $_POST['message'];

    // send email to admin
    $to = "admin@example.com";
    $subject = "New Contact Form Submission";
    $body = "Name: $name\nEmail: $email\nMessage: $message";
    $headers = "From: $email";

    // send email
    if(mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers)) {
      echo "Thank you for contacting us!";
    } else {
      echo "Error sending email.";
    }
  }
?>
In the PHP code above, we first check if the form has been submitted by checking if the "submit" button has been pressed. If it has, we retrieve the data from the form using the $_POST superglobal variable. We then construct an email message with the form data and send it to the admin using the mail() function.

Note that this is a simple example and additional validation and security measures should be implemented to ensure the form is secure and reliable.
