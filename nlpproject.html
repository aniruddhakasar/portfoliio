    <h2>Natural Language Projects.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
         I have delved into the fascinating world of human language
          and its computational analysis. Through my NLP projects, 
          I have developed a deep understanding of text processing, 
          sentiment analysis, information extraction, and language generation.
           Leveraging advanced techniques such as word embeddings, 
           recurrent neural networks, and transformer models, 
           I have built powerful systems that can extract valuable insights 
           from textual data. From sentiment analysis in social media to text
            summarization and language translation, my NLP projects showcase 
            the versatility and impact of computational linguistics.
             I am passionate about harnessing the potential of NLP to enhance communication,
              automate tasks, and unlock valuable information hidden within text. 
              Explore my NLP projects to witness the transformative power of language in the digital age</p>

                Successfully tested on Chrome search bar data.
                The training data passes through the training pipeline, with each
                operation executed sequentially. The training pipeline builds a LSTM
                NLP model. and execution report save as a logs in AWS S3 bucket</p>

            <p class="card-text">Chatting is an alternative communication method, but without facial
                impressions, it can be challenging to discern emotions solely from
                chat messages. To address this, I developed it ,that recognizes
                feelings with 88% accuracy by matching text patterns. The model
                can identify emotions such as joy, sadness, love, anger, and
                happiness. Additionally</p>

            <p class="card-text">Developed a fully customizable Dynamic chatbot from scratch.
              after developing this chatbot. you can use it chatbot and also modify the behaviour of this
              chatbot by just doing some editing in the dataset as per your
              requirements. you dont need to play with coding, just edit the dataset.
              it will look like just an Api after the completion, where you can use my chatbot,
               even you can also develop your chatbot just by editing the dataset.
               This project can be used as an API to develop your chatbot,
               i used LSTM, Cosine simelarity , Semantic Search , QA model, and code written in
