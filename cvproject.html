    <h2>Computer Vision Projects.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Computer Vision is an exciting field that combines the power
         of artificial intelligence and image processing. In my 
         computer vision projects, I have explored the intricacies 
         of visual data and developed algorithms that can extract
          meaningful information from images and videos. From object
           detection and recognition to image segmentation and facial 
           analysis, I have leveraged deep learning models and computer
            vision techniques to tackle complex visual tasks. By applying
             convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other cutting-edge 
             approaches, I have created systems that can accurately 
             identify and classify objects, track movements, 
             and analyze visual patterns. My computer vision projects
              demonstrate the potential of AI to perceive and understand
               the visual world, opening up endless possibilities in 
               fields such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, 
               and surveillance. Experience the power of computer 
               vision through my projects and witness the impact 
               it can have on transforming the way we interact with visual data.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I developed a web app where users can search for desired items by
                uploading their own images. My CNN and ML models then identify
                5 similar images from a database I prepared for this project. The
                database consists of 45k images representing various fashion
                collection items. The process involves the CNN model extracting
                features from the input image, which are then used by the ML
                model to find similar images.
